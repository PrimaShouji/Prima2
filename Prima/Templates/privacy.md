# Privacy
All messages the bot can see are stored for 7 days for deleted message logging. This data is not sent to any source besides right back to Discord.
All message attachments are stored separately from that until a modification to the main module of the bot (Prima.Stable on the GitHub repository [https://github.com/PrimaShouji/Prima2]) is deployed, which happens fairly frequently.
