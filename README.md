The Discord bot.

## Dev Environment Setup
Most of the configuration should work out of the box, but the following environment vars will need to be set up to allow the bot to run on your dev environment

| Environment Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRIMA_BOT_TOKEN | Yes |The login token for your dev environment bot. This will only work correctly with the bot after it is added and given permissions on your dev env discord server |
| FFXIV_HOME | No | The FFXIV local installation path if the local client is not installed in the default directory |
